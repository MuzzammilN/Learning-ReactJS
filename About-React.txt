main.jsx is the main javascript file
app component is the root component
index.html main entry of the document


To return two functions form the app function you will need to use a fragment
a fragment is <> </>

so your return function should look like something similair to this
return(
<>
<Header/>
<Footer/>
</>
);

You can't use class to set an object as in JSX class is a reserved name you have to use
className =""
